routing policies to control how requests are routed to your resources based on factors like latency, geography, and health of resources.

- **Simple routing:** Routes traffic to a single resource.
- **Weighted routing:** Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights. 30% traffic to resource A and 70% to resource B.
- **geolocation routing:** Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the user.
- **latency-based routing:** Routes traffic to the resource with the lowest latency for the user.
- **failover routing:** Automatically routes traffic to a healthy resource if the primary resource becomes unavailable.
- **multi-value answer routing:** Returns multiple IP addresses in response to DNS queries, allowing for simple load balancing and increased availability.
