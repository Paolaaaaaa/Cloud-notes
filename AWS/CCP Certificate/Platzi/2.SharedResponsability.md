# AWS Shared Responsibility Model


***Definition: The shared responsibility model defines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and the customer.***

AWS is reponsable of the security "of" the cloud, while the customer is responsible for security "in" the cloud.


## AWS Responsibilities (Security "of" the Cloud)
AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud.
- Data Centers: Physical security of data centers, including access control, surveillance, and environmental controls.
- Hardware: Maintenance and security of the hardware that supports AWS services.
- Hipervisors and Virtualization: Security of the virtualization layer that enables multi-tenancy.

## Customer Responsibilities (Security "in" the Cloud)
Customers are responsible for securing their data and applications that they run in the AWS Cloud.
- Data protection: Customers must ensure that their data is encrypted and access is controlled.
- Identity and Access Management: Customers are responsible for managing user access and permissions using IAM.
- Configurations of networking components: Customers must configure security groups, network ACLs, and other networking components to protect their resources.
- Compliance: Customers must ensure that their use of AWS services complies with relevant regulations and standards.
