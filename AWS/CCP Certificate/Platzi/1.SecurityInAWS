# Security in AWS


## Least Privilege Principle 

***Definition: The principle of least privilege is a security concept that dictates that any user, program or system should have the minimum level of access.***

### In AWS:
- **IAM Policies**: To create the user and roles with specific permissions.

## Root User

***Definition: A root user has access to all services and resources in an account.***

### In AWS:
- **Root User**: The root user is the account owner and has full access to all AWS services and resources.
- **Best Practice**: It is recommended to avoid using the root user for daily operations. Instead, use IAM users and roles with specific permissions.
- **Recommended Uses of Root User**:
    - Change account settings
    - Close the AWS account
    - Manage payment methods
    - Restore IAM user permissions

## IAM Users
IAM allows you to create users and roles with specifict permissions to access AWS services and resources.
### In AWS:
**Best Practices for IAM Users**:
- Don't use Root User for everyday tasks
- Create a IAM User with administrative privileges for daily tasks
- Monitor and setup petmits to IAM users with IAM Access Analyzer
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users 

## Good Practices for Security in AWS
### In Accounts:
- Enable MFA for root user and all IAM users
- Use strong passwords and rotate them regularly
- Create IAM users with least privilege access

### Ciphering and Data Protection:
- Activate ```ciphering by default for S3 buckets```
- Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys
- Data in transit: Use SSL/TLS for secure data transmission

### Manage Vulnerabilities:
- ```Use Amazon inspector``` to identify security vulnerabilities in your AWS resources
- Integrate ```AWS Security Hub``` to centrilize security findings and automate compliance checks

### Audit and Reporting:
- Use ```AWS CloudTrail``` to log and monitor account activity
- Check logs regularly for suspicious activity
