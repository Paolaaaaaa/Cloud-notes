### Economies of Scale
Economies of scale refer to the ability to achieve **lower variable costs** by using the AWS Cloud.  
By sharing infrastructure across many customers, AWS can reduce costs compared to running workloads **on-premises**.

Key ideas:
- Lower cost per unit as usage increases
- No need to maintain your own physical infrastructure
- Costs are distributed across multiple customers

---

### Cloud Economics Overview
The cloud changes how businesses manage IT resources.

Benefits:
- No need to administer physical data centers
- Pay only for what you use
- Focus on **value creation**, not infrastructure management

---

### AWS Pricing Principle: Pay as You Go
AWS follows a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model:
- No upfront investment
- Pay only for the resources you consume
- Scale up or down based on demand

---

### CapEx vs OpEx

#### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
Traditional on-premises model:
- Purchase of servers and hardware
- Data center facilities
- High upfront payments
- Fixed long-term costs

#### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
Cloud-based model:
- Pay for compute, storage, and services
- Variable costs
- No large initial investment
- Costs scale with usage

---

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

AWS helps reduce Total Cost of Ownership by:
- Eliminating hardware purchases
- Reducing data center maintenance
- Using managed services
- Automating operations
- Paying only when resources are used

Additional considerations:
- Some licenses can be reused (Bring Your Own License – BYOL)
- Certain software licenses are included in AWS services
- Managed services can further reduce operational costs over time

---
- Prevent overprovisioning and underprovisioning

---

#### Test at Production Scale
- Test systems as if they were in production
- Validate performance and behavior at scale

---

#### Automate Everything
- Infrastructure should be automated and repeatable
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Apply Continuous Deployment (CD)

---

#### Enable Evolutionary Architecture
- Make small, frequent, and controlled changes
- Adapt architecture over time

---

#### Drive Architecture Using Data
- Use metrics, logs, and monitoring
- Make decisions based on real data

---

#### Improve Through Game Days
- Simulate failures intentionally
- Observe system behavior
- Validate recovery mechanisms
