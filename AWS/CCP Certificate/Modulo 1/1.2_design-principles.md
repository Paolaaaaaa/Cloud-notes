# 1.2 AWS Cloud Design Principles

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps design, build, and operate systems that are:
- Resilient
- Highly available
- Secure
- Cost-optimized
- Sustainable

---

### Well-Architected Pillars

#### Operational Excellence
Ability to support development and operations efficiently.

Key concepts:
- Operate, monitor, and improve continuously
- Automate processes and procedures
- Continuous improvement
- Infraestructure as a Code <font color="cyan">(IaC)</font> 

---

#### Security
Ability to protect data, systems, and assets.

Key concepts:
- Protect data and access
- Secure systems and workloads
- Apply security at all layers

---

#### Reliability
Ability of a system to operate correctly and recover from failures.

Key concepts:
- Fault tolerance <font color="cyan">(NO DOWN TIME)</font>
- Recovery planning
- Automatic recovery from failures

---

#### Performance Efficiency
Efficient use of computing resources.

Key concepts:
- Select the right resources for the workload
- Use resources efficiently
- Continuously evaluate and optimize performance

---

#### Cost Optimization
Achieve maximum value at the lowest cost.

Key concepts:
- Allocate spending appropriately
- Monitor and optimize usage
- Avoid unnecessary resources

---

#### Sustainability
Reduce environmental impact.

Key concepts:
- Use only the resources needed
- Optimize workloads for efficiency
- Minimize energy consumption

## 3. AWS Architectural Best Practices


### Design Principles

#### Stop Guessing Capacity
- Cloud resources scale automatically : auto scalling
- Avoid buying servers based on estimations
- Prevent **overprovisioning** and **underprovisioning**

---

#### Test at Production Scale
- Test systems as if they were in **production**
- Validate performance and behavior at scale

---

#### Automate Everything
- Infrastructure should be automated and repeatable
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Apply Continuous Deployment (CD)

---
#### Enable Evolutionary Architecture
- Make small, frequent, and controlled changes
- Adapt architecture over time

---

#### Drive Architecture Using Data
- Use metrics, logs, and monitoring
- Make decisions based on real data

---

#### Improve Through Game Days
- Simulate failures intentionally
- Observe system behavior
- Validate recovery mechanisms
