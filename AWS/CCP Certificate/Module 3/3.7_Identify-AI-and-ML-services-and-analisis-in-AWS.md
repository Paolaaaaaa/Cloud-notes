# 3.7 Identify AI and ML services and analysis in AWS


## Machine Learning vs Artificial Intelligence (Base Concepts)

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.

> Used to solve Human Problems such as:
>  - Language
>  - Vision
>  - Pattern recognition
>  - Decision making
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.
> Uses historical data to:
>  - Learn patterns
>  - Make predictions

No need of a explicit set of rules.

## AWS Levels of ML in AWS
### Level 1: AI Services (APIs and pretrained models)

> "Use ML without ML expertise"

Characteristics:
- Pre-trained models
- Accessible via APIs
- No need to build or train models
- Selfadministered

Some examples:
## AI  Services (APIs and pretrained models)
| Service | Description | Typical Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Amazon Rekognition** <br> <img src="../Images/image-49.png" width="100"/> | Image and video analysis service | Object detection, facial recognition |
| **Amazon Lex**  <br> <img src="../Images/image-47.png" width="100"/> | Conversational AI service | Build chatbots and voice assistants |
| **Amazon Polly** <br> <img src="../Images/image-48.png" width="100"/> | Text-to-speech service | Convert text to natural-sounding speech |
| **Amazon Translate** <br> <img src="../Images/image-50.png" width="100"/> | Language translation service | Translate text between languages |

### Level 2: Machine Learning Services
> "Build, train, and deploy ML models at scale. For developers and data scientists."

## Machine Learning Services
| Service | Description | Typical Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Amazon SageMaker** <br> <img src="../Images/image-51.png" width="100"/> | End-to-end machine learning platform | Build, train, and deploy ML models at scale |


### Level 3: Frameworks and Infrastructure ML

> "Full control over ML models and infrastructure. For ML experts."

Includes:
- ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet)
- Custom model development
- Scalable infrastructure (EC2, GPU instances)
- Deep learning AMIs and containers


## Analytics In AWS 

> "Process and analyze large datasets to extract insights."

Use cases:
