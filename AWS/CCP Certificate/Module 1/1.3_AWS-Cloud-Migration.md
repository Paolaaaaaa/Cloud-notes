---

### Retire
- Turn off applications that are no longer needed
- Reduce costs by eliminating unused workloads

---

### Retain
- Keep applications on-premises
- Typically due to compliance, latency, or business constraints

---

### Rehost (Lift and Shift)
- Move applications to AWS **without changes**
- Fastest migration approach

---

### Relocate
- Move multiple servers or virtual machines together
- Minimal changes, often using virtualization tools

---

### Repurchase
- Replace existing applications with SaaS solutions
- Example: moving from a self-managed CRM to a cloud-based CRM

---

### Replatform
- Make small optimizations for AWS
- No major architectural changes

---

### Refactor / Rearchitect
- Redesign applications to be cloud-native
- Highest effort, highest long-term benefit
