# 2.3 Identify the capacities to administer Access to Aws
## Core Security Principles

- Not all users need the same level of access.

- Always apply ***the Principle of Least Privilege.***

- Security in AWS starts with IAM (Identity and Access Management).

### AWS Account

The AWS Account is the boundary where all AWS resources are created and managed.

### AWS Root User

- The first user created when an AWS account is set up.

- Has unlimited access to all AWS resources.

- Must NOT be used for daily tasks.

- **MFA must be enabled.**
- **Credentials should be stored securely.**

Used only for special or critical tasks.

### Tasks Only the Root User Can Perform

- **Change account-level user settings.**

- Restore IAM permissions if they are misconfigured.
- Activate IAM access to billing information.
- Create an account alias to replace the account ID in IAM users.


### AWS IAM Users

Represent individual identities within the AWS account.

Can authenticate using:
- Username and password
- Access keys (programmatic access)
- **Can have MFA enabled.**
Not recommended for applications.
**By default:**
- No permissions are granted until explicitly assigned.


### AWS IAM Groups

- Used to group IAM users.
- ***Permissions are assigned to the group, not directly to users.***
- Makes permission management simpler and more scalable.


### AWS IAM Roles

- Do **not** have permanent credentials.

- Use **temporary security credentials.**

Common use cases:

- An AWS service accessing another AWS service.

- Temporary access for users or services.

- Cross-account access.

- Applications and workloads running on AWS.


### AWS IAM Policies

Define permissions (what actions are allowed or denied).

Written in JSON format.

Can be attached to:

- Users

- Groups

- Roles

Must follow ***the principle of least privilege***.

### Types of Policies

**Managed Policies**

- Created and managed by AWS.

**Customer-Managed Policies**

- Created and managed by the customer.

### IAM Policy Simulator

A tool used to:

- Test and validate IAM policies.

- Understand and troubleshoot permissions.

- Clean up overly permissive access.

### Resource-Based Policies

- Policies attached directly to a resource, not to a user.

#### Amazon S3 Examples
**Bucket Policy**
- Applied at the bucket level.

- Defines who can access the bucket and what actions are allowed.

**User Policy**

- Applied to an IAM user.

- Defines which S3 buckets the user can access.


### Amazon Cognito

Used for authentication and authorization for applications.

**Commonly used for:**
- Web applications

- Mobile applications

Integrates with IAM but is designed for end users, not AWS administrators.
