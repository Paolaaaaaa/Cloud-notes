## 2.2 AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** defines that:
- **AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud**
- **The customer is responsible for security *in* the cloud**

## Shared Responsibility Overview

| AWS Responsibility (Security **of** the Cloud) | Customer Responsibility (Security **in** the Cloud) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Physical data centers                          | Data                                                 |
| Global infrastructure                         | Applications                                        |
| Hardware                                      | Identity and Access Management (IAM)                |
| Regions and Availability Zones                | Access configuration                                |
| Physical networking                           | Network configuration (Security Groups, firewalls) |
| Hypervisor                                    | Operating systems (for unmanaged services)          |
| Infrastructure supporting AWS services        | OS configuration and patching                      |
| High availability of services                 | Encryption                                          |
| Managed service infrastructure                | Traffic protection                                  |

## Customer Responsibilities (Security *in* the Cloud)

The customer is responsible for:
- **Data protection**
- **Application security**
- **IAM configuration**
- **Network security**
  - Security Groups
  - Firewalls
- **Operating system management** (when using unmanaged services like EC2)
  - Patching
  - OS configuration
  - OS security
- **Encryption**
- **Traffic protection**
- **Unmanaged services**

---

## AWS Responsibilities (Security *of* the Cloud)

AWS is responsible for:
- **Physical data centers**
- **Global infrastructure**
- **Hardware**
- **Regions and Availability Zones**
- **Physical network**
- **Hypervisor**
- **Underlying infrastructure**
- **Availability and resilience of AWS services**

For **managed services**, AWS also handles:
- Engine patching
- Infrastructure maintenance
- High availability

## Exam Tips

- **EC2** → You manage the OS and patches  
- **RDS / DynamoDB / Lambda** → AWS manages the OS and infrastructure  
- **Data and IAM** → Always the customer’s responsibility  
- **Physical security** → Always AWS’s responsibility
