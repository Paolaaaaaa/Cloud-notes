## 2.4 Identifying AWS Security Components and Resources

This section covers **which AWS security components to use in common scenarios** and how they differ at a high level.

---

## Network Security

### Security Groups (SG)
- Act at the **resource level** (EC2 instances, RDS instances)
- Control inbound and outbound traffic <font color="cyan">**Stateful**</font>  
  - If inbound traffic is allowed, the outbound response is automatically allowed
- Common use:
  - Protect EC2 instances
  - Control traffic at the instance level

---

### Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Act at the **VPC subnet level**
- Control traffic entering and leaving subnets
- <font color="cyan">**Stateless**</font>  
  - Inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately
- Support **explicit deny rules**
- Common use:
  - Additional layer of security
  - Block specific IP ranges at the subnet level

---

### Security Groups vs NACLs (Quick Comparison)

| Feature | Security Groups | Network ACLs |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Scope | Resource level (EC2, RDS) | Subnet level |
| Stateful | Yes | No |
| Explicit deny | No | Yes |
| Traffic control | Instance-level | Subnet-level |

---

### AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Protects web applications
- Filters and controls HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Blocks common attacks such as:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Malicious requests
- Works with:
  - CloudFront
  - Application Load Balancer
  - API Gateway

---

### AWS Marketplace
- Marketplace for **third-party security software**
- Can be used to deploy additional security solutions

---

### AWS Knowledge Center
- Provides official AWS guidance
- Best practices and troubleshooting documentation

---

## AWS Root User

### What is the Root User?
- The **first user** created when an AWS account is set up
- Has **unlimited access** to all AWS resources

---

### Root User Best Practices
- **Do NOT use for daily tasks**
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Store credentials securely
- Use only when strictly necessary

---

### Tasks Only the Root User Can Perform
- Change account-level user settings
- Restore IAM permissions
- Activate IAM access to billing
- Create an account alias to replace the account ID for IAM users

## Exam Tips

- **Security Groups** → Stateful, instance-level  
- **NACLs** → Stateless, subnet-level, explicit deny  
- **AWS WAF** → Protects web apps from SQL injection and XSS  
- **Root user** → Never for daily use, always MFA
